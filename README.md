# Yet another nvim configuration

This is just my Neovim configuration. Initially I was about to begin this project with forked Kickstart template, but opted to do this from scratch instead to have better understanding of the plugins and configuration options within Neovim.

Nothing really fancy here that you wouldn't find from any other source from the internet. Gathering stuff here along the way when needed. Aim is to have a decent and useable personal development environment for small hobby projects - and to have a easily portable configuration that can be used whenever there's a need to setup a new machine.

Leaving this repo public in case someone in the unforeseeable future might find this helpful.

That's all.

Telescope requires rirgrep and fd installed for full functionality.

`brew install ripgrep`

`brew install fd`

_(Note to self: perhaps automate the whole shenanigans into a single install script?)_
